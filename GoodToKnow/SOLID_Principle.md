# SOLID
SOLID is an acronym created by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob). 
It represents five principles of object-oriented programming: 
- Single responsibility, 
- Open/Closed, 
- Liskov Substitution, 
- Interface Segregation, and 
- Dependency Inversion.

By these principles, we can solve the main problems of a bad architecture:

* Fragility: A change may break unexpected parts—it is very difficult to detect if you don’t have a good test coverage.
* Immobility: A component is difficult to reuse in another project—or in multiple places of the same project—because it has too many coupled dependencies.
* Rigidity: A change requires a lot of efforts because affects several parts of the project.

What is a dispatch queue?
A DispatchQueue is an abstraction layer on top of the GCD queue that allows you to perform tasks asynchronously and concurrently in your application. Tasks are always executed in the order theyâ€™re added to the queue.

What is a serial queue?
A serial Dispatch Queue performs only one task at the time. Serial queues are often used to synchronize access to a specific value or resource to prevent data races to occur.

Creating a serial dispatch queue
A DispatchQueue defaults to a serial queue and can be initialized as follows:

```swift
let serialQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "swiftlee.serial.queue")

serialQueue.async {
    print("Task 1 started")
    // Do some work..
    print("Task 1 finished")
}
serialQueue.async {
    print("Task 2 started")
    // Do some work..
    print("Task 2 finished")
}

/*
Serial Queue prints:
Task 1 started
Task 1 finished
Task 2 started
Task 2 finished
*/
```

Exercise 1: Write an R or python script that generates M data points of a polynomial of degree N. Plot your solutions for different values of N and M (using randomly generated or fixed data points).

Polynomial: A polynomial is a mathematical expression consisting of variables (also known as indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponentiation of variables. 
A simple example is: p(y)=3x2-2x+1
Here, N = 2, Coefficients are 3,2,1.
